5/11/2020 9:56:20,8LL-1,10,4,I prefer this format,I would rather a software is actually taught in class for me to use,-Soft deadlines before hard,"-students are given very little instructions when completing a school map, can teach how to use map-making softwares in class ",-Incorporate more Formative activities and ATL skill assessments,"Mr. Harry organises the classroom effectively and is energetic. He uses adequate teaching strategies and usually makes the students justify their answers and provide rationale to the class materials. Also, he is able to relate class materials to real-life events, demonstrating an excellent model to the rest of the class. Sometimes, however, he is struggling to help the students with direction and clarified instructions. To improve, he can provide more help to the students by not only organising Formative activities but also various ATL skill assessments. This will allow the students to get to know about the unit more. 

Even with that being said, I am truly impressed with the following positive accomplishments Mr. Harry has achieved:

-Encourages students to do their best
-Relates class material to real life events
-Challenges students to explain their opinions and answers
-Follows the IB MYP curriculum, manages class efficiently
-Attempts to clarify uncertainties students may potentially have 
-Is energetic
-Demonstrates excellent organisational skills students can learn from
-Involves a variety of teaching styles
-Is willing to hear what the students think
